# DP_Multiplayer_Game

This project was developed as part of my university degree.

This project was an intersting one as prior to this I'd never really had to program anything networked based and learnt a lot about optimal connections and data transfer.
I'm sure if I thoroughly looked through this project I'd find 1,000 optimisations but this was from years back now.

Maybe this will help some uni student finish their degree. 

Remember, It's not plagerism if you reference ;)
